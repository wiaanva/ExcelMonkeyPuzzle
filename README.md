# ExcelMonkeyPuzzle
A monkey puzzle VBA form that presents question and answer options that a user provides inside the excel document.  Not a full blown data management system but there is data.. So that counts right? hehehe

# This is my first attempt at writing a program (So be gentle).  I have had some experience with VB6 but only at a maintenance level.  Was still very cool to do.

Current bugs I need to sort out:
1. There is an error when closing the application.

Further development required:
1. Randimising the questions and answer options within each question.
2. Neater error handling (Prefer a nice stop prompt.

Feel free to share/improve/break.. but leave a like why don't ya?
